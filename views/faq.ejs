                        <p>It can be difficult to determine this on your own, which is why we're here to help! Generally, hardware issues involve physical components (like a broken screen or non-functioning keyboard), while software issues involve programs, applications, or the operating system. Don't worry about categorizing it perfectly - just describe the symptoms, and our technicians will properly diagnose the problem.</p>
